# Getting Started With Runme via SSH

Runme strives to provide a great experience right out of the box, with Runme you can connect to instance and preform explicit instruction using markdown docs. Before diving into different SSH authentication methods to use, ensure you've installed Runme for VS Code or CLI by following the [installation](/install#runme-for-vs-code) guide.

# SSH Authentication Methods

Secure Shell (SSH) is pivotal for secure remote server access. Here, we explore various authentication and exuction methods, each with its unique setup and security level.

### Authentication via Cloud Provider SDK

Leverage your cloud provider's SDK to streamline SSH authentication. Hereâ€™s how you can do it using Google Cloud SDK:

#### Steps:

Install Google Cloud SDK: Follow the official guide to [install]() and initialize the SDK.

Authenticate: Use gcloud auth [login](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/ssh#--command) to authenticate your Google Cloud account.

```sh
# short for "runme tui"
runme
```

### Key-Based Authentication

Enhance security by using SSH keys for authentication, eliminating the need for password transmission and reducing the risk of brute-force attacks.

### Steps

* Generate SSH key Pair: Use `ssh-keygen` to create a new SSH key pair

```sh
ssh-keygen
```

* Transfer Public key: Employ `ssh-copy-id` to copy your public key to the remote server's authorized keys.

```sh
ssh-copy-id user@host
```

SSH Connection: you will be able to establish an SSH connection

```sh
ssh user@host 'command'
```

### Password Authentication Using sshpass

with the use of `sshpass` it helps automate SSH connections with password authentication.

### Steps

**Set Password:**

Safeguard your SSH password using an environment variable.

```sh
export SSHPASS="your_secure_password"
```

**SSH Connection:**

Employ sshpass to supply the password and establish an SSH connection.

```sh
sshpass -p "$SSHPASS" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@host 'command'
```

- **Password Authentication** is straightforward but comes with notable security risks, especially when automating and storing passwords in scripts or environment variables.
- **Key-based Authentication** provides a higher level of security and is recommended for most use cases, especially in production environments, despite needing a bit more setup initially.

Choosing the right method often involves considering the balance between ease of use and security. In scenarios where security is paramount, opting for SSH key authentication is prudent.
