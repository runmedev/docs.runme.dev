# Security Overview

## Telemetry and Connection to home.runme.dev

The connection to `home.runme.dev:443` is part of Runme's telemetry system, which is used to collect anonymous usage data for improving the product. All data collected is free of personally identifiable information (PII), ensuring that user privacy is respected.

The telemetry system is designed similarly to an anonymous tracking pixel, a common method used by many open-source projects to gather basic, non-intrusive metrics. Stateful runs the open-source Runme kernel, and this telemetry is part of maintaining and enhancing the open-core functionality of the platform.

If you wish to disable telemetry, instructions are provided in the [telemetry configuration documentation](https://docs.runme.dev/configuration/telemetry). This allows you to fully opt-out of any data collection while continuing to use the Runme platform.

## Unix Domain Socket (UDS) Support for Enhanced Security

To accommodate environments with stricter security requirements, Runme provides the option to use a Unix Domain Socket (UDS) instead of the default TCP/loopback connection. Switching to UDS can reduce the attack surface by avoiding TCP-based connections and is recommended for certain high-security environments.

You can enable this option within the VS Code settings by navigating to `runme.server.transportType` and selecting UDS instead of TCP. This provides an additional layer of security for users who prefer or require a socket-based communication method.
