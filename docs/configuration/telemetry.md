title: Telemtry

Your privacy is of utmost importance. Runme collects telemetry information, all of which is pseudo-anonymized (no PII). Runme respects both [VS Code's global "no telemetry"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry) (id: `telemetry.telemetryLevel`) setting and the common `DO_NO_TRACK=1` environment variable.

Telemetry collected includes:

- Buttons clicked & commands triggered
- Total cells and how many are executed
- Extension activation and deactivation
- Notebook opened and saved (incl. metadata; file names are obfuscated)

If you don't wish to participate in telemetry, please deactivate it using the available settings.
