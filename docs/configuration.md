# Cell Configuration

To get the best of RUNME, and to offer a fantastic README experience, RUNME has a cell configuration option which allows you to indicate how the cell will be executed.

## Configure Cell's Execution

Not all commands are equal, and expectations of how execution works can differ! For example, code blocks can be to be:

1. File-watchers for compilers & bundlers should run as background tasks
2. Executors for Interactive and Non-interactive programs & scripts
3. Human-centric output: JSON, text, images, etc
4. Terminal visibility when no errors occur

Just click "Configure" on the respective cell to make modifications to the cell execution behavior:

If you feel more comfortable editing the markdown file directly, you can do it by using the following configuration options schema:

```sh
```sh { interactive=false name=echo-hello-world }
echo hello world ```
```

Try out the previous command

```sh
echo hello world
```

The entire configuration schema as an example

```sh
```sh { interactive=true name=example mimeType=text/plain closeTerminalOnSuccess=false background=false }
echo hello world ```
```

Take a look at more [examples](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/tree/main/examples) available inside the VS Code extension repo for a reference on how to apply these code block attributes in different use cases!

## Specify Language in Blocks

Runme, just like most Markdown viewers, will work best when a script's language is contained inside of fenced code blocks.

If possible, always specify the language [according to the markdown standard](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting) as is illustrated below:

```
    ```sh
    $ echo "language identifier in fenced code block"
    ```
```

<Infobox type="warning">

Out of the box, Runme will leverage the [Guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang) ML/AI model with a bias towards Shell to detect the languages for unidentified code blocks.

While this works well in a lot of cases, the accuracy is nowhere near 100%!

## Handle long-running processes

It is very common to use file-watcher enabled compilers/bundlers (`npm start dev`, `watchexec...` etc) in the background during development.

For any cell containing an instance of these commands be sure to tick the "background" cell setting. This will prevent execution from permanently blocking the notebook UX.

![background task process in vs code](../static/img/background-task-process.png)

Once ticked notice the "Background Task" label shows up in the cell status bar!

**Default:** `false`

**Example**

    ```sh { background=true }
    npm run watch
    ```

## Interactive vs non-interactive cells

If a cell's commands do not require any input from a reader it might be a good fit to include the cell's output inside the notebook. This is useful if the resulting output could be useful as input in a downstream cell. This is what `interactive=false` is for, and it defaults to *true*.

![interactive execution in vs code](../static/img/interactive-execution.png)

**Default:** `true`

**Example**

    ```sh { interactive=false }
    openssl rand -base64 32
    ```

<Infobox type="sidenote">

Please note that the Runme team is currently working on making output in both notebook & terminal default behavior.

## Terminal visibility post-execution

A cell's execution terminal is auto-hidden unless it fails. This default behavior can be overwritten if keeping the terminal open is in the interest of the Runme notebook reader. Just untick `closeTerminalOnSuccess` (`false`).

**Default:** `true`

**Example**

    ```sh { closeTerminalOnSuccess=false }
    docker ps | grep runme/demo:latest
    ```

## Human-friendly output

JSON, text, images, etc. Not all cells’ output is plain text. Using the `mimeType` specifier it is possible to specify the expected output's type. Notebooks have a variety of renderers that will display them human friendly. The MIME type defaults to *text/plain*.

See below for the list of supported MIME types!

## Configuration Option Reference

| Configuration         | Description                                                    | Default value |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------| ------------- |
|  background  | Indicates if the cell should be runned as a background process | false         |
|  interactive | Indicates if run should allow interactive input                | false         |
|  closeTerminalOnSuccess | Hide Terminal after cell successful execution       | true          |
|  mimeType    |  Cell’s output content MIME type                               | text/plain    |
|  name        | Cell’s canonical name useful for referencing the cell via CLI  | auto-generated |
|  promptEnv | Prompt user to set exported environment vars | true |
