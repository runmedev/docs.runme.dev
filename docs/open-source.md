# Open Source

We are committed to building Runme in the open and hope you get involved. Runme's core repos are licensed under the broadly-accepted APL 2.0 license and its sources are freely available on Github.

## Project Breakdown

Runme lives in three repositories on Github:

* The project's website at [runme.dev](https://runme.dev)
* The [Runme repo (CLI and execution engine)](https://github.com/stateful/runme)
* The [Runme VS Code extension](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme)

You can also follow Runme's [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/stateful/projects) to see in progress development.

## Getting help

We encourage you to log [issues in Github](https://github.com/stateful/runme/issues), or [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/stateful) - we look forward to hearing what you have to say.
