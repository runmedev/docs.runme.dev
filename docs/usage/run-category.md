# Run cells by category

If you have multiple workflows in a single Markdown file you can categorize them and allow your developers to run all cells by a certain category. To enable that you can add a category as a cell option. A cell can have one or multiple categories that are comma-separated.

**Default:** `""`

**Example**

````sh
  ```sh {"category":"build","id":"01HPM7Q4JQ5HVJ5KS2FJ7Q31SQ"}
    # Do something here
````

<video autoPlay loop muted playsInline controls>
  <source src="/videos/categories.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="/videos/categories.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
<br />
