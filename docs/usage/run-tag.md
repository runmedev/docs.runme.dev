# Run cells by tag (formerly "category")

If you have multiple workflows in a single Markdown file you can categorize them and allow your developers to run all cells by a certain tag. To enable that you can add a tag as a cell option. A cell can have one or multiple categories that are comma-separated.

**Default:** `""`

**Example**

````sh
  ```sh {"tag":"build","id":"01HPM7Q4JQ5HVJ5KS2FJ7Q31SQ"}
    # Do something here
````
