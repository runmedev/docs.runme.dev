# Runme Cloud Renderers

## Overview

Cloud renderers is a Runme tool that enables you interact with various cloud resources to manage and deploy your cloud-native application. The ​​Runme Cloud Renderers integrate with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services ([AWS](../cloud-render/aws.md)) and Google Cloud Platform ([GCP](../cloud-render/gcp.md)), which allows you to manage and deploy virtual machines, run containerized applications using Kubernetes, and perform cloud services for diverse applications, all within your Markdown file.

With this integration, you can perform tasks such as listing and managing clusters, retrieving cluster information, pausing clusters, connecting to instances via SSH, etc. All these operations can be done within a single interface without opening cloud consoles separately.

This section provides detailed instructions to guide you through using Runme Cloud Renderers with cloud platforms like [AWS](../cloud-render/aws.md) and [GCP](../cloud-render/gcp.md). These instructions will help you perform routine deployment tasks efficiently within one interface.
