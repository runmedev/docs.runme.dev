Open the `Extensions Tab` in the VS Code sidebar and search for **"Runme"**.

Alternatively, you can go to the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stateful.runme) and click the green `Install` button.

That's it. Now, any time you open a Markdown file (`*.md` or `*.mdx`) it will open as a Runme notebook.

## Pre-release: Test drive new features early

A pre-release version is offered for curious developers who want to try our latest enhancements to the extension. Head to the extension configuration and click Switch to Pre-release Version to use it. If you donâ€™t see such an option, ensure your VS Code is at least 1.63.0.

## The TLDR

Install the VS Code runme extension just like every other VS Code extension, open any `.md` / `.mdx` file in VS Code with commands, then click to run them (and much more). Then go create your own custom runnable markdown files!
