# Install for Web

This section will provide step-by-step instructions on installing Runme on your Web.

Runme’s Notebook UX is built on the VS Code platform. This gives us the additional advantage of leveraging the [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) project to run it as a local, self-contained web application.

## How to Install Runme on Web

To install Runme on the web, you are required to run the Runme command in your CLI. For this command to be executed rightly, you need to first have Runme installed in CLI. If you haven't already installed Runme CLI, please complete the steps in [installation](/installation/cli) before proceeding.

1. Open your terminal on your local machine.
2. Run the command below

```sh {"id":"01HQR1SNB432H0KF49HSNWWK5Q"}
runme open
```

This command will automatically open Runme in your default web browser and set up a Runme `code-server`.
