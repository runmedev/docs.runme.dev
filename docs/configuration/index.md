# Configuration

To get the best of Runme, and to offer a fantastic README experience, Runme has a cell configuration option which allows you to indicate how the cell will be executed:

1. Cell-level Options
2. Document-level Options

Furthermore, Runme supports shebang to run all sorts of languages.
