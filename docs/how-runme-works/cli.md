# How Runme CLI Works

<Infobox type="sidenote" title="Install Runme">

If you haven't already installed Runme CLI, please complete the steps in [installation](https://docs.runme.dev/install#runme-cli) before proceeding.

</Infobox>

Runme has a nice TUI that you can use simply like so:

```sh
# short for "runme tui"
runme
```

![Runme TUI Usage](../../static/img/runme-tui.gif)

his allows you to quickly execute any script present in the README.

<Infobox type="warning" title="Warning!">

Runme won't work if your current working directory doesn't contain a README file at the top level!

You can use the `--chdir` flag to alter the working directory or `--filename` to specify any other markdown file, without changing the environment's working directory.

### Available commands

Runme parses every shell or bash code block of a markdown file and allows you to execute it within your terminal environment. It comes with several commands that help you to run code blocks in your markdown successfully:

```

### Run a markdown file

By default, Runme will try to open a `Readme.md` file in your current work directory but you can modify this by using the `filename` and `chdir` flags, e.g.:

```sh
runme ls --filename README.md --chdir ../..
```

You can also specify a full path in `filename`:

```sh
runme ls --filename ../../README.md
```

### Running Commands Directly

The TUI is nice, but what if you just want to run a specific command quickly?

To run a specific script by name, use the `runme run <command>` subcommand.
