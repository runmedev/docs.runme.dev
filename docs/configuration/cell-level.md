title: Cell-level Options

Not all commands are equal, and expectations of how execution works can differ! For example, code blocks can be:

1. File-watchers for compilers & bundlers should run as background tasks
2. Executors for Interactive and Non-interactive programs & scripts
3. Human-centric output: JSON, text, images, etc
4. Terminal visibility when no errors occur

To modify the cell execution behavior, simply click "Configure" on the respective cell.

If you feel more comfortable editing the markdown file directly, you can do it by using the following configuration options [schema](reference#Cell-Options):

```md
```sh { interactive=false name=echo-hello-world }
echo hello world ```
```

The above example uses the echo command to display the text "hello world" on the terminal. The context { interactive=false name=echo-hello-world } indicates that the command is intended for non-interactive execution and has been labeled accordingly.

```sh

Try out the previous command

```sh
echo hello world ```
```

The entire [configuration schema](reference#Cell-Options): as an example

```sh
```sh { interactive=true name=example mimeType=text/plain closeTerminalOnSuccess=false background=false }
echo hello world ```
```

Take a look at more [examples](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/tree/main/examples) available inside the VS Code extension repo for a reference on how to apply these code block attributes in different use cases!

</Infobox>

### Specify Language in Blocks

Runme, just like most Markdown viewers, will work best when a script's language is contained inside of fenced code blocks.

If possible, always specify the language [according to the markdown standard](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting) as is illustrated below:

```sh
    ```sh
    echo "language identifier in fenced code block"
    ```
```

<Infobox type="warning">

Out of the box, Runme will leverage the [Guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang) ML/AI model with a bias towards Shell to detect the languages for unidentified code blocks.

While this works well in a lot of cases, the accuracy is not perfect.

### Handle long-running processes

It is very common to use file-watcher enabled compilers/bundlers (`npm start dev`, `watchexec...` etc) in the background during development.

For any cell containing an instance of these commands be sure to tick the "background" cell setting. This will prevent execution from permanently blocking the notebook UX.

![background task process in vs code](../../static/img/background-task-process.png)

Once ticked notice the "Background Task" label shows up in the cell status bar!

**Default:** `false`

**Example**

    ```sh { background=true }
    npm run watch
    ```

### Cell's current working directory

In most cases, you probably want to set the current working directory at the document-level, however, it is possible to set it per cell.

    ```sh { cwd=.. }
    npm run watch #relative path
    ```
    
    ```sh { cwd=/tmp }
    echo "absolute path" > dummy_file
    ```

<Infobox type="warning">

Please note that if both `cwd` are set for doc-level and cell they don't overwrite they combine. E.g. `cwd: /tmp/dummy` (doc) and `cwd: ..` (cell) will result in `/tmp`.

</Infobox>

### Interactive vs non-interactive cells

If a cell's commands do not require any input from a reader it might be a good fit to include the cell's output inside the notebook. This is useful if the resulting output could be useful as input in a downstream cell. This is what `interactive=false` is for, and it defaults to *true*.

![interactive execution in vs code](../../static/img/interactive-execution.png)

**Default:** `true`

**Example**

    ```sh { interactive=false }
    openssl rand -base64 32
    ```

<Infobox type="sidenote">

Please note that the Runme team is currently working on making output in both notebook & terminal default behavior.

</Infobox>

### Set environment variables

If a cell has exported variables, the user will be prompted to set these variables. This can be useful to have a parameterized cell while not needing to manually modify the cell.

![prompt user in vs code](../../static/img/interactive-prompt.png)

**Default:** `true`

**Example**

    ```sh { promptEnv=true }
    export SLEEP_SECS=0
    sleep $SLEEP_SECS
    ```

### Terminal visibility post-execution

A cell's execution terminal is auto-hidden unless it fails. This default behavior can be overwritten if keeping the terminal open is in the interest of the Runme notebook reader. Just untick `closeTerminalOnSuccess` (`false`).

**Default:** `true`

**Example**

    ```sh { closeTerminalOnSuccess=false }
    docker ps | grep runme/demo:latest
    ```

### Human-friendly output

JSON, text, images, etc. Not all cellsâ€™ output is plain text. Using the `mimeType` specifier it is possible to specify the expected output's type. Notebooks have a variety of renderers that will display them human friendly. The MIME type defaults to *text/plain*.

![Human-centric output](../../static/img/human-centric-output.png)

See below for the list of supported MIME types!

### Exclude Cell from Run All

Every VS Code notebook allows to run all available cells. This can be useful if you define a complete runbook in your markdown file and it allows developers to just click the "Run All" button to get set-up and running. However sometimes certain cells should be excluded from this workflow. With the `excludeFromRunAll` option you can configure this behavior.

**Default:** `false`

**Example**

    ```sh { excludeFromRunAll=true }
    # Do something optional here
    ```

### Run All Cells by Category

If you have multiple workflows in a single markdown file you can categorize them and allow your developers to run all cells by a certain category. To enable that you can add a category as cell option. A cell can have one or multiple categories that are comma seperated.

**Default:** `""`

**Example**

    ```sh { category=build }
    # Do something here
    ```
    
    ```sh { category=build,deployment }
    # Do something here
    ```
