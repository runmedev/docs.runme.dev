# Install the CLI

Runme works effectively on the CLI. If you are a power user who enjoys running Markdown files from the terminal of your local machine, this section is for you.

![cli](/img/terminal.png)

Here, we will give you detailed instructions on how to install Runme on your CLI.

## Install Runme On MacOS

To get started, one of the easiest ways to install Runme on MacOS is by using [Homebrew.](https://brew.sh/)

Before you proceed, ensure you have the latest version of Homebrew on your local machine, use the command below to update if needed:

```sh {"id":"01HMXXFJFXWEN7ER7PSYKQNH3C","name":"brew update"}
brew update
```

Once you have the latest version of Homebrew, proceed with installing Runme. Use the command below to install:

```sh {"id":"01HMXXF11NA3BJNCDYQAED3654"}
brew install runme
```

You should see a similar output if Runme is successfully installed.

```sh {"id":"01HQK3K4B8AC82PPT9370P49FD"}

Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.
Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).
```

## Installing Runme On Windows

Windows users can also conveniently install Runme using any of the two options.

- Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) or
- [Scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh/) a command-line installer for Windows

### Installing Runme on Windows Using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2

Runme is currently available only on the Cloud-native Shell Kernel, which makes it more compatible with a Linux operating system than a Windows operating system. To use Runme effectively on a Windows OS, you need to install and utilize the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2)

To install the Runme CLI on your WSL server, follow these steps:

- **Install WSL**

Run the command below to install WSL on your Windows machine:

```bash {"id":"01J58R4TJ430708WYDMTRV0677"}
wsl --install
```

- **Connect to WSL**

Next, connect your machine to WSL, run the command below:

```bash {"id":"01J58R4TJ430708WYDMWVPMT8N"}
wsl
```

This will connect your machine to your WSL server.

- **Install Runme CLI**

After successfully connecting to the WSL server, you should install Runme CLI on your remote server.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is one of the easiest ways to install Runme CLI. However, you must ensure you have the latest Brew version. Once that is done we can proceed to install the Runme CLI with [Brew](https://docs.runme.dev/installation/runmecli#install-runme-on-macos).

```bash {"id":"01J58R4TJ430708WYDMXAZKVD4"}
brew install runme
```

While Homebrew provides an easy way to install Runme using the `brew command`, you can also conveniently install Runme using other platforms, such as `curl` and `wget`, regardless of your operating system. See the “Installing Runme Binary” section.

### Installing Runme on Windows Using Scoop.sh

With Scoop, you can quickly install and set up your Runme CLI on your Windows machine.

Run the commands below on your terminal to install Runme:

```bash {"id":"01J58R4TJ430708WYDMXQ6D5FN"}
scoop bucket add stateful https://github.com/stateful/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install stateful/runme
```

## Installing Runme Binary

Alternatively, you can explore Runme's [releases](https://github.com/stateful/runme/releases) and choose the binary that corresponds to your operating system.

Example:

You can use `curl` or `wget` to install the runme binary

```bash {"id":"01HQW47K686SC6V7S5TH3Z7AFQ"}
wget https://download.stateful.com/runme/3.1.0-rc.0/runme_darwin_x86_64.tar.gz
```

Move the `runme` binary to **`/usr/local/bin`** (recommended) or **`/bin`** (as per your request)

```bash {"id":"01HQW47K69NQ6XZG26TQSP44MW"}
sudo mv runme /usr/local/bin/ # or /bin/runme if you went that route
```

Verify the binary is in the path and executable.

```bash {"id":"01HQW47K69P24D0JYBPQN0N755"}
which runme
```

This command should output the path to the binary, confirming it's in your system's PATH. To ensure it's executable, you can explicitly set executable permissions:

```bash {"id":"01HQW47K69ZTYTGC6998GF77VV"}
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/runme  # or /bin/runme if you went that route
```

Run the binary by simply typing `runme`

```bash {"id":"01HQW47K69QVW77PN5NTARQZMX"}
runme
```

If you have a different preferred distribution mechanism, feel free to inform us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/runme). We will be glad to explore it.

### Install Runme using Go

Additionally, we have provided an option for Go developers to install Runme. If you are a [Go](https://go.dev/) developer or you have Go developer tools installed, you can install Runme directly using the `go install` command.
Simply use the command below to carry out this installation:

```sh {"id":"01HQK3RSC9YSH5NM2AE503GRB5"}
go install github.com/stateful/runme@latest
```

<Infobox type="warning" title="Warning!">

The displayed version may appear as “0.0.0”. This is an expected behavior and does not affect functionality

If you don't have Go developer tools installed and still want to use this method, download and install Go.

## Basic Usage with Runme TUI

Runme provides a user-friendly text-based user interface (TUI) that allows users to interact with Runme through typed commands and responses displayed on their screen.

This TUI can be accessed using the command `runme tui` or just `runme` . These commands essentially allow you to quickly execute any script present in the README.

The video below displays Runme’s TUI and how to access its features using the command.

![Runme TUI Usage](/img/runme-tui.gif)

<Infobox type="warning" title="Warning!">

Runme would not work if your current working directory does not contain a README file at the top level! You can use the `--chdir` flag to alter the working directory or `--filename` to specify any other Markdown file, without changing the environment's working directory.

</Infobox>

Runme parses every shell or bash code block of a Markdown file and allows you to execute it within your terminal environment. It comes with several commands that help you to run code blocks in your Markdown successfully:

```sh {"id":"01HMXWHNSWH5DV8A9P289P8SSE"}
